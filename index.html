<h1>
<a id="code-of-conduct" class="anchor" href="#code-of-conduct" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code of conduct</h1>

<p>To follow the rules of conduct are essential to ensure good and fruitful collaboration:</p>

<ul>
<li> Be open: We invite anyone to participate in any aspect of our projects. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by a contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.</li>
<li> Be considerate: People use our work, and we depend on the work of others. Consider users and colleagues before taking action. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy, and documentation may negatively impact others.</li>
<li> Be respectful: We expect people to work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and act with empathy. Do not turn disagreements into personal attacks.</li>
<li> Be collaborative: Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. We strive for transparency within our open source community, and we work closely with upstream developers and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts.</li>
<li> Be pragmatic: Questions are encouraged and should be asked early in the process to avoid problems later. Be thoughtful and considerate when seeking out the appropriate forum for your questions. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.</li>
<li> Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, they should make it known and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.</li>
</ul>

<p>This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.
Diversity Statement</p>

<p>We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we all agree that everyone is equal.</p>

<p>Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.</p>

<p>Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.</p>
