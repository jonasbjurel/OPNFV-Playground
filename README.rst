- Code, innovation, derivates and contribution must be licensed under Apache2
  (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
- Code, innovation and derivates shall be built on top of OPNFV and associated/rellevant
  upstream projects.

- Contributors must follow the code of conduct for this repository - see below.
- New contributors shall apply by following the guidlines stated in ONBOARDING.rst
- New projects shall apply by sending a project proposal through a git pull request.

CODE OF CONDUCT
===============
To follow the rules of conduct are essential to ensure good and fruitfull collaboration:

Be open: We invite anyone to participate in any aspect of our projects. Our community
is open, and any responsibility can be carried by a contributor who demonstrates the
required capacity and competence.

Be considerate: People use our work, and we depend on the work of others. Consider
users and colleagues before taking action. For example, changes to code, infrastructure,
policy, and documentation may negatively impact others.

Be respectful: We expect people to work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions,
and act with empathy. Do not turn disagreements into personal attacks.

Be collaborative: Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work.
We strive for transparency within our open source community, and we work closely with
upstream developers and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts.

Be pragmatic: Questions are encouraged and should be asked early in the process to avoid
problems later. Be thoughtful and considerate when seeking out the appropriate forum for
your questions. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or
disengages from the project, they should make it known and take the proper steps to ensure
that others can pick up where they left off.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of
a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as
much as in the letter.

DIVERSITY STATEMENT
===================

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all.
Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we all agree that everyone is equal.

Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it.
If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and
respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, culture,
ethnicity, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, political beliefs,
profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability.
We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above,
including participants with disabilities.
