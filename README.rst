This repository aims to facilitate and extend the use of the "Open Platform Network Virtualizatzation" AKA "OPNFV" open source initiative (www.opnfv.org).

It is a free-standing open source repository initiative not governed by any organization.

The intention of this repository is to invite to free contribution and innovation based on OPNFV and OPNFV upstream results.

Contribution and innovation must align with the following intentions:
- Code, innovation, derivates and contribution must be licensed under Apache2 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
- Code, innovation and derivates shall be built on top of OPNFV and associated/rellevant upstream projects.
- Contributors to this repository grants an unconditional free right to any-other (person, organizition or corporation) to freely use-, and as of will submit work to any other third-party (limited to the content of this repository and specificalluy excluding any references to other sources-, repositories-, and other arts)
- Contributors must follow the code of conduct for this repository - see below.
- New contributors shall apply by following the guidlines stated in ONBOARDING.rst
- New projects shall apply by sending a project proposal through a git pull request.

Code of conduct:
To follow the rules of conduct are essential to ensure good and fruitfull collaboration:

    Be open: We invite anyone to participate in any aspect of our projects. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by a contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.

    Be considerate: People use our work, and we depend on the work of others. Consider users and colleagues before taking action. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy, and documentation may negatively impact others.

    Be respectful: We expect people to work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and act with empathy. Do not turn disagreements into personal attacks.

    Be collaborative: Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. We strive for transparency within our open source community, and we work closely with upstream developers and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts.

    Be pragmatic: Questions are encouraged and should be asked early in the process to avoid problems later. Be thoughtful and considerate when seeking out the appropriate forum for your questions. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

    Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, they should make it known and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.
Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we all agree that everyone is equal.

Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.
